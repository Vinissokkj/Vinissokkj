  <summary>👨‍💻 More about me</summary>

  - 💬 I am 19 years old, currently living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

  - ✨ I got into programming because of my friend João Gabriel, at about the age of 12 he told me about this site building thing, but I just thought it was a cool way he made money at the time. Fast forward 6 years, he contacted me on steam and I got amazed by how his life changed because of programming. He inspired me to get into Computer Science at his University and that's what I did! He supports me and is a great inspiration, I'm really thankful for him.
